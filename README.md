#  XOXO

**Your journey, perfectly crafted with intelligence.**

Experience planning is overwhelming—juggling dozens of tabs, comparing conflicting info, spending hours just to get started. XOXO makes that disappear. It's a revolutionary multi-agent AI system that not only creates complete experience itineraries but also connects you with compatible co-experiencers for shared adventures. Experience blind matching based on trust and budget compatibility, plus AI-powered adventure challenges that make your journey unforgettable.

> **Note**: This project is currently under development and has some known issues.

## 🎯 Goal

Make experience planning effortless, personal, and social. No stress, no endless research, no experiencing things alone unless you want to—just a plan that feels crafted specifically for you and a compatible experience companion.
